# ArrakisND

[![Pytest](https://github.com/Neutron-Calibration-in-DUNE/ArrakisND/actions/workflows/test_package.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Neutron-Calibration-in-DUNE/ArrakisND/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Arrakis module for the near detector data. This module can run in two modes, stand-alone or as part of an H5Flow. Input files should be flow files from nd-larsim or data runs, which are then converted into training data sets for Blip.
